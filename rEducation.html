          Most computer engineering positions require the candidate to have a bachelor's degree in computer science, computer engineering or software engineering. Sometimes, those with exceptional programming and technical skills may secure employment without a degree. Computer engineering programs receive their accreditation from the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), which ensures that your education meets coursework, training and other credentialing standards. Completing an accredited program also increases your chances of being hired by a reputable organization.

          A master's degree in data science, AI and cyber security can help computer engineers to increase their earning potential. A master's degree in business administration (MBA) can help computer engineers transition from a technical role to a managerial or executive role, which can lead to a larger earning potential.
