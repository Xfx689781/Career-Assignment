            Computer engineering is a branch of computer science and electrical engineering. This field of study combines several disciplines to design <br> and develop software and hardware systems. You can learn more about computer engineering and how to become a computer engineer in the <br> following article. Computer engineers work with all  aspects of computer operating systems, from software to robotics. As a computer engineer, <br>you’ll work closely with other engineers and programmers to design computer systems and test their functionality. You’ll remain current with <br>the latest technology and update software and hardware to keep systems running smoothly.

        <p style="position:relative; left: 280px; top:2px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: 'playfair display', cursive; color: rgb(179, 103, 4); text-indent:30px;"> The computer made the twenty-first century become the century of technology. Over the last decades, the computer engineering field has just <br>got a good base with desktops, websites, and software. It’s now expected to achieve some remarkable success in machine learning, big data, and <br> robotics.
            Not to mention we’re just on the verge of entering the Age of Artificial Intelligence, which means the potential for AI applications is <br> essentially unlimited. Yet, it will necessitate computers of almost inconceivable complexity. 
            And it’s no surprise that computer engineers will be in <br>high demand for the foreseeable future. As pioneers in technology, they surely will have a bright future, at least in a few decades.
            Computer <br>engineering will certainly not become obsolete, but you must consider the rapid changes in this field.

             AI mainly focuses on machine coding that can mimic human intelligence. AI experts build algorithms and program machines to perform <br> human-like tasks.
            Specifically, AI applies to many fields, from detecting credit card fraud and disease outbreaks to optimizing satellite navigation.<br>
            As predicted, some AI concepts have been widespread in recent years, and there is even a rumor that AI will take over many jobs in the future.
